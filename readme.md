## Problem 1 ##
Solved in three ways: for loop, Gauss's formula, recursive
## Problem 2 ##
- Load data from the API once and store it in a global variable (to avoid calling the API multiple times and wasting resources).
- Listen to the input event on the amount input box to update the value immediately.
- Automatically update the results in the output box every time the user changes the input value or selects a different token.
## Problem 3 ##
